                <h3>Welcome to JS2 Group 5's page</h3>
                <p>We will provide you with services beyond your imagination. There are a lot of people these days
                    that face problems when in comes to the VVS at their home. It can be lack of warm water, element
                    that is not working
                    as it should and much more.

                    A sewer lateral line is your home’s sewer and pipe system. This line is responsible for connecting
                    your home to the
                    city’s waterline. This means that your sewer lateral line brings fresh water into your home and
                    removes waste away from
                    your home too. These crucial functions require well-maintained pipes in order to operate.

                    If your sewer lateral line has been cracked or damaged, it’s important to call in the professionals
                    at Challenge Rooter
                    right away. We’ll start by assessing the damage with our video cameras. Once we get an idea of the
                    scope of the issue,
                    we can offer you an assessment and lay out your options for repair and replacement.

                </p>

                <p>To maintain your lawn’s appearance and make sure our worksite is safe, we offer trenchless sewer
                    lateral repair and
                    replacement services. This is both cost-effective and time-saving and provides excellent results as
                    we don’t have to dig
                    up your property but can still perform our work.

                    If you only need a simple repair, we can insert a pipe liner or sleeve into the old pipe which
                    allows us to create a new
                    pipe within your pipe and repair the affected area. If you need sewer lateral replacement, we can
                    insert a new pipe
                    through the existing sewer line, breaking away the old line.
